    <h2>Description </h2>
<p> are you trying to become a body builder but eating plain ole chicken and rice is causing you togo back to binging 3 day old chinese well try out this recipe and see why cooking can be healthy and tasty.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul> 
    <li>1½ L water ((to boil chicken))</li>
    <li>1 large chicken leg</li>
    <li>3 scallion whites ((save greens as garnish))</li>
    <li>1 slice ginger</li>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>4 cloves crushed garlic</li>
    <li>1 shallot or small yellow onion</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<li>Wash the chicken thoroughly (this gives you a clearer broth to serve later on).</li>
<li>Season chicken with 2 tbsp of salt. (this might seem like a lot but remember you're boiling it)</li>
<li>Bring water up to a boil then throw in scallions, ginger, garlic, turmeric powder, and pinch of salt. Make sure there is just enough water to cover the chicken.</li>
<li>Drop the chicken leg into the water and bring heat down to a simmer to cook for 25 minutes.</li>
<li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare your rice ingredients (wash rice, chop shallots, garlic and ginger)</li>
<li>Using 1 tbsp of oil, fry shallots, ginger, and garlic for 1-2 minutes over high heat.</li>
<li>Add rice, and tumeric powder then mix until combined and set aside in rice cooker.</li>
<li>Once the chicken is cooked through, take it out and immediately place in an ice bath for 10 minutes (this gives it that springy elastic chicken texture).</li>
<li>Pour 1¼ cups of the chicken broth (broth made from cooking chicken) into the rice cooker and cook accordingly. Don't worry about oil from the chicken in the stock, that adds extra flavor.</li>
<li>While I wait for the rice to cook I usually make the ginger scallion oil and chili sauce. Ginger scallion oil is a must for this dish, chili sauce is optional but recommended. (I will link a full recipe post for the sauces below this recipe card.)</li>
<li>To make the chili sauce, combine all chili sauce ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.
</li>
<li>To make the ginger scallion oil, finely chop ginger and scallions, if you're lazy just grate the ginger(the finer the better) then add salt and pour over hot oil.</li>
<li>De-bone chicken (recommended)</li>
<li>Plate the rice and brush chicken with sesame oil. Serve with sauces and top with green onions!
