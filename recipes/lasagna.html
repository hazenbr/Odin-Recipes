    <h1>Description</h1>
    <P>Are you tired of having a cat that always complains about mondays. all the while eats all of your precouis store bought lasagna leaving you nor your significt other any leftover. well instead of buying frozen lasagna every night learn how to make you very own. </P>
    <p>I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.

        This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. 
        
        This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.
